#Saga Choreography
Welcome to the Saga Choreography project! ðŸš€ This initiative showcases the powerful implementation of Saga patterns in a microservices architecture, providing a robust solution for managing distributed transactions seamlessly.

##Why Saga Choreography?
In today's world of microservices, ensuring data consistency and resilience across services can be a challenge. Saga choreography addresses this by allowing each service to participate in a decentralized manner, leading to:

Flexibility: Each service can evolve independently, adapting to business needs without disrupting others.
Resilience: If one service fails, the others can still function, enhancing the overall system stability.
Speed: Real-time communication among services allows for faster transaction processing and improved user experience.
Key Features
##Event-Driven
Architecture: Utilizes messaging to trigger actions and communicate between services.
##CompensationLogic: 
Handles failures gracefully with built-in compensation strategies.
##Easy Integration: 
Built with Java 17 and Spring Boot 3.x for a modern and efficient development experience.
